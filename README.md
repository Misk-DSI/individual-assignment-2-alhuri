# Red Wine Quality EDA

## Dataset Information
The dataset of red "Vinho Verde" wine is used for EDA task. For further information,
refer to [Cortez et al., 2009]. The data contains physicochemical variables and quality as a target variable.

Variables:
- fixed acidity - most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile.
- volatile acidity - the amount of acetic acid in wine.
- citric acid - citric acid can add ‘freshness’ to wines.
- residual sugar - the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops.
- chlorides - the amount of salt in the wine.
- free sulfur dioxide - the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2.
- density - the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.
- pH - describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 to 14.
- sulphates - a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels.
- alcohol - the percent alcohol content.
- quality - score between 0 and 10
